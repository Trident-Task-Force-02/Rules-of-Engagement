### Reading the Rules of Engagement Documentation
All RoE Cards are categorized in sections, titles, game mode, and identification number. __I might update this for more read-a-bility__

_Reading the ID Numbers:_
- (__"X"__-X-0.0) : represents the RoE Cards' Game Mode
- (X-__"X"__-0.0) : represents the RoE Cards' Game Category (For example, Multiplayer, Zombies, Battle Royale, etc.)
- (X-X-__"0"__.0) : represents the Section
- (X-X-0.__"0"__) : represents the RoE Cards' Number

For example, in Multiplayer :  __Section "TDM-MP-0.1"__

For example, in Battle Royale :  __Section "PLUNDER-BR-0.1"__ (Same goes for DMZ, replace "PLUNDER" ID to "DMZ" ID)_

For example, in Zombies :  __Section "ZOMBIES-MWZ-0.1"__
